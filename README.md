The AI Virtual Mouse project employs computer vision and machine learning to provide hand gesture control over an alphanumeric computer cursor by using simple hand movements. In this application, computer vision algorithms can detect real-time video inputs from a webcam and interpret the movements of the user's hand into actions that their cursor may make-examples of which include movement and clicks as well as scrolls. It is particularly helpful in situations where touchless interaction becomes an advantage, like reduced contact in shared environment or providing an ergonomic solution for extended periods of computer use.
